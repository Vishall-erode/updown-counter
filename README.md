Up/Down Counter in Verilog
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an up/down counter using Verilog. Counters are essential components in digital electronics used for counting occurrences, clock cycles, or other events. This up/down counter can increment or decrement its count based on a control signal.

Features
Clock Signal: Drives the counter.

Reset Signal: Resets the count to zero.

Up/Down Control Signal: Determines whether the counter increments or decrements.

Counter Output: Displays the current count.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of an up/down counter in Verilog. The counter increments or decrements based on a control signal and is resettable. The provided testbench allows for thorough verification of the counter's functionality.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this code for your projects. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
